                        <p>This datascience project blog describes the dataset chosen by the author, and the reason to do so. Following this, it talks about the general problems that were faced working with the data. Questions to address from the dataset were pre-determined. However, often times, as the author has observed, as the grip on the data increases by differents ways that help understand meaningful relations - the capacity to ask the right questions increases. Being the first project, it took the author some time to play with the data, and come up with anything useful for the audience. The blog also contains some technical details, which will be progressively moved to a github link <a class="link-primary" href="https://github.com/pattmehta/Area_production_and_farm_gate_value_of_marketed_fruits">here</a>.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Obtaining the Dataset</h2>
                        <p>There are various sources online where dataset can be obtained. As a general feeling, the author could feel that the data was already curated and structured. In addition to this, the description of this available dataset would contain the questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used - which is basically the whole point of doing this exercise. The dataset for the purpose of this project has been obtained from Statistics Canada website.</p>

                        <p>
                            <img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/img/canada-stat-svg.svg" alt="canada logo" />

                        <h4>Area, production and farm gate value of marketed fruits</h4>
                        
                        <p>Visit this <a class="link-primary" href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210036401">link</a> to download the dataset. This dataset is updated annually, and holds valid for the entire geography of Canada including the territories. It consists of various commodities, which are edible fruits. The dataset contains the following features on these commodities</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>geography, i.e. the province or territories where the commodity was grown or sold</li>
                            <li>reference date, i.e. the year for which the data was recorded</li>
                            <li>farm area, production, or value, to describe what kind of value is provided</li>
                            <li>estimates, uom, i.e. the unit representing the commodities' value, e.g. Average price per pound, Pounds</li>
                            <li>commodity, i.e. the name of the commodity along with its ID (we do not use the ID), e.g. Fresh blueberries [1141114]</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Questions to Look For</h2>
                        <p>Before selecting these questions, the author studied import-export in Canada as a side course. During this time, the author was heavily relied on random websites on the internet to get statistical information on the products relevant to the coursework. So, the questions chosen here go from simple to complex, as sometimes getting answers to simple questions grows our capacity to ask complex questions. Moreover, the code and the data needs to be tested, and so getting answers to simple questions helps in early validation of the project.</p>

                        <p>In addition to this, having lived in different cities in Canada - it made sense to ask questions on living expenditure, and to see trends on how the prices vary in different provinces for a given commodity. Therefore, following are the questions that this project tries to address in some ways.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Are there certain commodities preferred for production/price-increase?</li>
                            <li>If so, does the area of cultivation also show some relation to the price change (or any other relation that can be obtained)?</li>
                            <li>Since it is a known fact that commodities' price increases with time, is it possible to model this relation, along with other data (such as the province)?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <!-- heading -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Towards a Cleaner Data</h2>
                        <p>A small proportion of the dataset has null values. Fixing these cells by removing them or replacing them is an important aspect of working on any datascience project. Pandas provides some useful built-in methods that can be used for this purpose. It is important to use these methods to remove the missing values from our dataset. <u>If we skip this stage, our code might break in different places</u>. Some operations we perform on our dataset using Pandas expect the missing values to be removed.</p>
                        <h4>dropna</h4>
                        <p>We can use this method to remove null values from rows or columns. We can also specify criteria to drop these cells for specific columns only using <code>subset</code>. Or, we can drop when an entire row or column has null values. Either way, this step is important. Another approach might be to fill the missing values. For example, if a column is numeric, we can use the mean value for this column to fill the missing values using the <code>fillna</code> method that Pandas provides.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Using Groups Effectively</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes a dataset may have a large number of categorical columns. Each of these columns can make it easy for us to get lost in the details that the dataset is providing us. When the data is originally collected, it is in a raw format. It makes more sense at that stage, to put everything in one place in the raw form. But for interpreting meaningful results, we do not need all the details.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                            <img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/img/geo_commodity_ascending_portion.png" alt="marketed production" />
                            <span class="caption text-muted">marketed production value (in kg)</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>We can use <code>groupby</code> on the dataframe to group one or more columns into a single index. Once that is done we can easily narrow down on any column. The results above show a small slice of the marketed production values (in <b>kg</b>) for the group <code>GEO-Commodity</code>. Note that it has also been sorted using <code>sort_values</code> to display a horizontal bar plot.</p>


                        <!-- heading -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Using Plots for Visualizations</h2>
                        <p>One of the biggest strengths of using <code>matplotlib</code> is that it enables us to put different plots in the same place. This allows for a better understanding of what the data is trying to tell. Sometimes, we can go wrong when we are looking at the data in only one way. Putting different plots together is helpful because it reduces the chances of interpreting the data in an incorrect manner.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">NOTE: As there are different commodities in this dataset, it makes sense to select a few for comparison and move ahead with them. Here, we have picked blueberries and grapes.</blockquote>

                        <p>
                            <img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/img/blueberry_grapes_comparisons.png" alt="commodity comparisons" />
                        </p>

                        <p>From the plots above, we see that there is a drastic difference in the price (<b>$</b>), production (<b>kg</b>), and cultivation (<b>acre</b>) values, for the picked commodities (blueberries and grapes in this case).
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">NOTE: You might have noticed an additional detail about the year axis for the price plot. It is discussed at the end, and is not relevant for now.</blockquote>
                        <p>For the middle plot, there seems to be some missing data between 1975 and 2000 for blueberries. Otherwise, we see a very clear picture that not only blueberries are priced more, but they are also cultivated more than grapes.</p>
                        

                        
                        <h4>Answer Time</h4>
                        <p>The answer is true for the first question we wanted to address from the dataset. Since we put all the findings in one place, we can also see that the answer to the second question is also true.</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>✅ Are there certain commodities preferred for production/price-increase?</li>
                            <li>✅ If so, does the area of cultivation also show some relation to the price change (or any other relation that can be obtained)?</li>
                        </ol>


                        <!-- heading -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Model for the Data</h2>
                        <p>In order to predict, say, the future price of a commodity we need to train/fit a model. Training a model means to derive certain values from the input (X, y), that can help create simple mathematical equations to give the best approximation for the values themselves. The algorithm uses differentials (internally) to generate these values.</p>
                        
                        <p>When we say we are training a model, it means we are calling functions that will generate these values for us. But we still need to provide the inputs (X, y). X are (could be singular) some of the columns from our dataset, and y is a column that depends on X. For e.g. X could be a column with label 'year' (containing numerical years) and y could be a column, say 'price' (containing numerical prices in $), that depends on X.</p>

                        <p>In our case, X is composed of two columns - year and province. Since we want to predict the price of a commodity, y in this case would be the price column (for the given commodity). These values do not automatically get passed onto the model. We need to select the X columns, and the y column separately. We then pass it to the model. As our model uses linear mathematical equations internally, we use the <a class="link-primary" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html">LinearRegression</a> model. Finally, we can call <code>LinearRegression().fit(X, y)</code> to train/fit the linear model.</p>

                        <!-- heading -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Interpreting the Coefficients</h2>
                        <p>After training the model, we can access its properties and methods to understand the relations between X and y, and also predict y using an unknown X. This becomes clear on observing the following bar plot. Here, we simply plot using <code>plt.barh(X.columns,model.coef_)</code>. The <code>columns</code> property is a collection of columns from X, and the <code>coef_</code> property is a collection of values that signify how strongly (or weakly) a given column relates to y.</p>

                        <p>
                            <img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/img/model_columns_coeffs.png" alt="model coefficients" />
                            <span class="caption text-muted">plot of column names and the corresponding coefficients</span>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>As we can see from above, y (i.e. the price of the commodity) depends <b>positively</b> on REF_DATE (i.e. price increases with increase in year) and GEOs (i.e. the province) British Columbia, Quebec, <b>while</b> y depends <b>negatively</b> on GEOs Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island.</p>


                        <!-- heading -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Obtaining the Results</h2>
                        <p>Since our X is composed of columns - REF_DATE and GEOs, we can put together these values inside a dictionary for better representation (it is easy to read and modify in this manner). The code below contains three dictionaries <code>priceInCanada2025</code>, <code>priceInNewBrunswick2025</code>, and <code>priceInBC2025</code>. Each dictionary encapsulates the values (X) we intend to pass to our model to predict the price (y).</p>

                        <p>Finally, as shown in the screenshot below, we call the <code>predict</code> method on our linear model to obtain the result. To visualize, we use the <code>plot</code> function.</p>

                        <p>The plot we see above contains the price values along the y-axis. The x-axis contains the province names as labels, where, the label for Canada is used to show the average price value on the plot, and how the other provinces compare against it, in terms of the price.</p>
                        <h4>Answer Time</h4>
                        <p>The answer is true for the last question we wanted to address from the dataset. We were able to successfully create a model and predict price value using X, that is composed of REF_DATE and GEO province data.</p>
                        
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>✅ Since it is a known fact that commodities' price increases with time, is it possible to model this relation, along with other data (such as the province)?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <!--  heading  -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Areas for Improvement</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.</p>
                        <h4>year of reference</h4>
                        <p>The max value for the REF_DATE column in the dataset is very low (1981) as seen previously in the plot. This could cause problems, as REF_DATE is not relevant, and we want to predict the latest prices of the commodity. At the moment, however, the prediction for the price seems to be working fine in terms of the linear relation. In a nutshell, we should query the dataset before we create the model, to ensure that the values of interest meet the expectations. Otherwise the result that we obtain might not be relevant.</p>
